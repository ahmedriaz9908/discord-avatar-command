Discord avatar command using discord.js, enjoy lol
if my bot.js file isnt working let me know

Also, the main code file is here only, you need a package.json file as well, as well as have discord.js installed.

The bot wont run without the token, which u can obtain from the developer portal. 
also you can adjust the variable `prefix` to whatever prefix you want for the bots command(s)
